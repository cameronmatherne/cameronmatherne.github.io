            My Story
          </h2>
          <p class="section-subheading text-light" style="font-size: 15px">
            I was 16 years old when I first started working in the service
            industry. My first job was working as a bar-back at Le Pavillon, a
            local reception venue. I worked there for a year, until I turned 18
            and could get my bar card to step into the bartending scene. During
            my days as a bar-back, I always admired the bartenders. Not because
            they were my bosses, but because they genuinely enjoyed what they
            were doing. Their enthusiasm, the way they engaged with guests,
            crafted fantastic drinks, and exuded confidence - they were the
            heartbeat of the party. The day I turned 18, I got my bar card, and
            I was ready to dive into bartending. I continued working at Le
            Pavillon another year, bartending. A few months before turning 19, I
            landed a position at Ruffino's on the River. To earn my spot behind
            the bar, I started as a busboy and bar-back while still juggling
            shifts at Le Pavillon. I even spent my 19th birthday bar-backing at
            Ruffino's on a busy Saturday night. My commitment to becoming a
            seasoned bartender for both Le Pavillon and Ruffino's was
            unwavering. One day, and a family friend asked if I could work as a
            bartender for a "private event." Excitedly, I agreed, partly driven
            by the need for extra cash. While working this private event, I was
            approached by guests wondering if I had business cards. I hadn't
            considered business cards or taking private events seriously until
            that moment. The questions about them during the event sparked
            something in me. The day after, thoughts of starting my own company
            flooded my mind. Over a year later, I've turned that inspiration
            into reality. I am now a private event bartender, combining mixology
            knowledge with fast and entertaining service.
          </p>

            How it works
          </h2>
          <p class="section-subheading text-light" style="font-size: 15px">
            Once a time is reserved, we can arrange a meeting for me to answer
            any questions you may have prior to the event. On the day of the
            event, I will arrive an hour before the scheduled time to prepare my
            bartending station. The client provides a bar area, for example a
            designated space at the location of the event, tables if needed, ice
            chests, beer, wine, and ice for cocktails. The client provides all
            alcohol mixers, cups, napkins, and I provide all bartending
            equipment. I charge by the hour; Once you book with me, I will be
            willing to work an event as long as neccessary. Additionally, no
            event is too soon, and it is never to early to book with me. So
            let's get this party started and book with Bronson!

            "We hired Bronson to bartend a private event, and he delivered
            creative cocktails and spectacular service. He arrived early to set
            up his service station. He mixed excellent mocktails and cocktails
            and was engaging with our group. His spicy margarita was excellent!
            We would highly recommend Bronson for your upcoming eent, whether a
            dinner with frineds or company holidu party. Leave the bartending to
            him, and spend time enjoying your company.
