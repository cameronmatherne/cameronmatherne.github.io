ingredients:
- Olive oil, for coating the pan
- 8 ounces bulk spicy Italian sausage
- 4 medium leeks, light green and white parts only, cleaned of grit and diced
- 3 garlic cloves, finely grated
- Kosher salt and freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
- 1 (4.5oz) tube tomato paste
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 1 tsp jarred chopped Calabrian chilis, or red chili flakes to taste (optional)
- 1 pound large shells or rigatoni
- 2 ounces mild goat cheese
- ¼ cup heavy cream
- ½ cup freshly grated pecorino, plus more for serving
- Fresh torn basil, for serving
directions:
- Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat to cook the pasta.
- Meanwhile, add oil to coat the bottom of a large pot and heat until hot. Add in sausage and brown, breaking up with the back of your spoon until browned, 6-7 minutes. Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon to a plate and set aside.
- Add the leeks to the sausage drippings and cook over medium low heat, stirring, until very soft, 15-20 minutes. Add in the garlic and cook for another 1 minute. Return the sausage to the pan.
- Add tomato paste and cook over medium heat, stirring, until it begins to darken in color, about 2-3 minutes. Stir in the chilis.
- Deglaze with wine and let reduce slightly, 1-2 minutes. Turn the heat to low.
- Season the boiling water heavily with salt. Drop in the pasta and cook until al dente.
- While the pasta cooks, finish the sauce. Add in the goat cheese and cream along with a couple ladlefuls of pasta water to help thin the sauce and melt the cheese into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Turn the heat to low as pasta finishes.
- Drain the pasta and add to the pan with sauce (reserving the pasta water!). Stir to coat the pasta in the sauce, adding more ladles of pasta water to create a silky saucy consistency. Stir in the pecorino. Add more pasta water as needed to create a creamy and emulsified sauce. Season with more salt and pepper if needed.
- Serve garnished with more grated pecorino, more black pepper, and basil.
