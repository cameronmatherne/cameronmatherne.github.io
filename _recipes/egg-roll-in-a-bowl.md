ingredients:
  - 1 lb lean ground pork or ground turkey
  - 1 small onion, diced
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 tbsp ginger, grated or minced
  - 4 cups fresh shredded cabbage, thinly sliced (or 1 bag coleslaw mix)
  - 1 cup shredded carrots
  - 1/2 cup bell pepper, sliced thinly
  - 2 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce or tamari
  - 1 tbsp rice vinegar

  - 1/2 tsp black pepper
  - 1/2 tsp chili flakes (optional, adjust to taste)
  - 2 green onions, sliced for garnish
  - Sesame seeds for garnish (optional)
directions:
  - Heat a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the ground pork or turkey and cook, breaking it apart, until browned and cooked through (about 6-8 minutes). Drain any excess fat if necessary.
  - Add the diced onion, garlic, and ginger to the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes until fragrant and softened.
  - Stir in the cabbage, carrots, and bell pepper (or the bag of coleslaw mix). Cook, stirring frequently, for 5-7 minutes, until the vegetables are tender but still have a little crunch.
  - Add soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, black pepper, and chili flakes (if using). Toss everything to coat evenly and cook for another 1-2 minutes to combine flavors.
  - Remove from heat, garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds if desired. Serve hot.
