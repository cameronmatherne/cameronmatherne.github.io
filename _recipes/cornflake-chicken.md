ingredients:
  - 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken tenders
  - 1 cup crushed cornflakes (lightly crushed, not powder)
  - 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/2 tsp paprika
  - 1/2 tsp black pepper
  - 1/4 tsp salt (adjust to taste)
  - 2 large egg whites
  - Cooking spray or 1 tsp olive oil for spraying
directions:
  - Preheat your air fryer to 400°F (200°C).  
  - In a shallow bowl, whisk the egg whites until smooth.  
  - In another bowl, combine crushed cornflakes, Parmesan, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.  
  - Dip each chicken tender into the egg whites, letting excess drip off, then coat evenly with the cornflake mixture.  
  - Place the coated tenders in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Spray lightly with cooking spray or olive oil.  
  - Air fry for 10–12 minutes, flipping halfway, until the chicken is cooked through (165°F internal) and golden brown.  
  - Serve hot with your favorite low-calorie dipping sauce or a squeeze of lemon.
