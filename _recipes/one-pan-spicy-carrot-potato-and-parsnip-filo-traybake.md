ingredients:
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, diced
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp chilli powder, plus extra to serve
- 1 tsp cumin powder
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 large carrots, roughly chopped (not peeled)
- 4 large potatoes, roughly chopped (not peeled)
- 2 parsnips, roughly chopped (not peeled)
- 1 x 400g tin chickpeas
- 500ml veg stock
- 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 350ml yesterday's butternut squash soup (or 200g cooked butternut squash blended with 200ml veg stock)
- 3 tbsp butter, I'm using a plant-based version
- 270g filo pastry
- 1/2 tsp caraway seeds
- salt and black pepper, to taste
- Serve with a salad
directions:
- You will need an ovenproof skillet or baking dish.
- Preheat the oven to 160°C fan.
- Heat the oil in a large ovenproof skillet, once warm add the onion, stirring occasionally until soft. (If the skillet isn’t oven-proof, tip the mixture into a baking dish before you bake it).
- Add the garlic, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp chilli powder and cumin powder, stir to combine and cook for 1-2 minutes. Add the tomato paste and salt, stir to coat.
- Add the carrots, parsnips, and potatoes and stir well to coat everything, then tip in the whole can of chickpeas - including the water from the can. Add the vegetable stock and bring to the boil, then turn to a simmer and cook for 20 mins, until the vegetables are beginning to soften. Remove from heat.
- Mix the nutritional yeast with the 300ml of yesterday’s soup and add to the cooked veg.
- Meanwhile, in a frying pan over medium heat, melt 3 tbsp butter and gently fry 1/2 tsp caraway seeds, 1 tsp smoked paprika and 1/2 tsp chilli powder and cook for 2 minutes. Unwrap the filo pastry and brush one of the sheets with the spiced butter mixture and then scrunch up to look a little like a rose. Snuggle all of the scrunched-up filo pastry onto the top of the filling. Slide into the oven and bake for 15-18 mins, until the tops of the pastry are golden brown.
