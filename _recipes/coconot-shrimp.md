  - 1 lb large shrimp, peeled and deveined
  - 2 medium sweet potatoes, cut into 1-inch cubes
  - 1 red bell pepper, sliced
  - 2 tbsp light coconut milk (unsweetened)
  - 1 tbsp lime juice
  - 1 tsp lime zest
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika

  - 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/4 tsp black pepper
  - 1/2 tsp sea salt (adjust to taste)
  - 1 tbsp olive oil

directions:
  - Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C). Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.
  - In a large bowl, toss sweet potato cubes with 1/2 tbsp olive oil, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
  - Spread the seasoned sweet potatoes in a single layer on one side of the sheet pan and roast for 15 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, in the same bowl, combine light coconut milk, lime juice, and lime zest. Add the sliced red bell pepper and toss to coat.
  - After the sweet potatoes have roasted for 15 minutes, remove the sheet pan from the oven. Add the bell peppers to the pan and gently toss to combine with the potatoes.
  - Nestle the shrimp on top of the sweet potatoes and bell peppers, then lightly drizzle any remaining coconut-lime mixture over the shrimp.
  - Return the sheet pan to the oven and roast for 8–10 minutes more, until the shrimp are pink and cooked through and the sweet potatoes are tender.
  - Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley before serving. Serve hot.
