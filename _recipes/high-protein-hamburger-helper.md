  - high-protein
  - low-calorie
ingredients:
  - 1 lb lean ground beef (90% lean or higher)
  - 1 small onion, diced
  - 2 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 lb protein pasta
  - 1 cup low-sodium beef or chicken broth
  - 1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese
  - 1/2 cup shredded reduced-fat cheddar cheese
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1 tsp chili powder
  - 1/2 tsp black pepper
  - 1/2 tsp salt
directions:
  - In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef with diced onion until browned and cooked through (about 6–8 minutes). Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. Drain excess fat if needed.
  - Add the protein pasta to the skillet and stir to combine.
  - Pour in the broth and add smoked paprika, chili powder, salt, and pepper. Stir well and bring to a gentle simmer.
  - Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 8–10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is cooked through and most of the liquid is absorbed.
  - While the pasta cooks, blend the cottage cheese until completely smooth using a blender or food processor.
  - Remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the blended cottage cheese and shredded cheddar cheese until creamy and well combined.
  - Let sit for 1–2 minutes to thicken before serving. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Serve hot.
