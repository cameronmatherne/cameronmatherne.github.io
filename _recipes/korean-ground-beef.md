ingredients:
  - 1 lb lean ground beef (90–95% lean)
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 small onion, sliced
  - 1 red, yellow, or orange bell pepper, sliced
  - 1 zucchini squash, sliced
  - 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce or tamari
  - 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - 1 tbsp rice vinegar
  - 1 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste, optional for spice)
  - 1 tsp ginger, grated
  - 1 tsp black pepper
  - 1/2 tsp chili flakes (optional)
  - 2 green onions, sliced for garnish
  - Sesame seeds for garnish (optional)
directions:
  - Heat a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking it apart, until browned and cooked through (about 6–8 minutes). Drain excess fat if needed.
  - Push the beef to one side of the pan and add the sliced onion. Cook for 2–3 minutes until slightly softened.
  - Add the garlic and ginger and cook for 30–60 seconds until fragrant.
  - Add the bell pepper and zucchini to the pan. Stir-fry for 3–4 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still slightly crisp.
  - In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, gochujang (if using), black pepper, and chili flakes.
  - Pour the sauce over the beef and vegetables and stir well to coat evenly. Cook for another 1–2 minutes to let everything come together.
  - Remove from heat and garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds if desired. Serve hot.
